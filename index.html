The STM Program creates partnerships between students and faculty in exploring the use of digital media in the classroom. STMs receive intensive training and unique experiences that prepare them for success in education and career. They work closely with LaGuardia faculty, helping them design, create, utilize, and maintain technology-enriched teaching resources. Many STMs have gone on to pursue technology careers in four-year colleges, and several have remained on the Center staff as Instructional Design Assistants (IDA) and ePortfolio Consultants.<p>
The STMs reflect the economic and demographic diversity of the LaGuardia student body. For some STMs, this is a first-time working experience, providing crucial workplace experience. Others have been able to leave exhausting, dead-end jobs in sweatshops and fast-food restaurants. An STM position, in contrast, focuses students' energy at the college and helps them acquire new perspective on learning and teaching -- even as they gain entry-level access to rewarding professional careers. Among our STMs this year are students born in Nepal, Ecuador, Colombia, Japan, Peru, Egypt, Mexico, Turkey, China, Korea, Pakistan, Poland, Dominican Republic, India, Bangladesh, Irland, Sweden , and other countries.</div><!---text1-->

        <p>The Student Technology Mentor (STM) Program was created to provide assistance to students and faculty in developing and designing web-based technology projects. It has offered an opportunity for selected LaGuardia students to learn new skills and contribute to the Center's broader initiative. The STMs reflect the economic and demographic diversity of the LaGuardia student body. Among our STMs are students born in Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, China, Poland, Dominican Republic, Nepal, and many other countries.

        Providing instructional and technical support for LaGuardia faculty, students (with a focus on courses that emerged from the Designed for Learning faculty seminar) and the ePortfolio initiative, the Student Technology Mentors receive intensive training and unique experiences that prepare them for success in education and career.</p>

        <p><u>Training</u> - Prior to beginning their work with a faculty partner, STMs go through a semester-long intensive training program, led by CTL Associate Director, Josephine Corso, where they learn the computer applications used by faculty in their web-enhanced courses using Blackboard and ePortfolio. Then the STM is assigned to a specific faculty member; they work 15 hours per week, and usually have two or more faculty partners. Many STMs apply this work experience to their internship requirement.

        The STM training continues through the following semester, with weekly sessions offering advanced software training conducted by Ali Abdallah. STMs are also introduced to digital photography, scanning images and text, and photo editing. In addition, Ms. Corso facilitates discussions on workplace relationships and the educational role of the STM. The weekly sessions provide STMs with the opportunity to share their work experience, ask questions, get feedback, and receive continued support from the CTL staff as well as from one another. In addition to the direct connections made with faculty and CTL staff, STMs develop a community of mutual support that helps to open new opportunities for educational and career advancement.</p>

        <p><u>Work</u> - STMs work closely with LaGuardia faculty, helping them design, create, utilize, and maintain technology-enriched teaching resources. STMs meet with faculty on a weekly basis to help them plan and prepare digital resources such as on-line activities, multimedia presentations, or make revisions to course web sites. STMs attend related classes to work as teaching assistants, supplementing the work of faculty and the IT staff, and helping students use the digital resources as effective learning tools. Faculty who work with STMs have been effusive in their praise of the students and the value of their assistance.</p>

Working and Learning Experience - As part of their working and learning experience, STMs create a client-based web page using Dreamweaver and a personal ePortfolio, advancing their proficiency in web page development. They also complete a tutorial project, which may require researching an advance software applications, developing instructional materials about the topic, and presenting it to other STMs as a training workshop. The learning advantages to this project are manifold, developing skills in research, writing, production, and oral presentation. Taking responsibility for their own learning, they come to see themselves as teacher/learners who have important expertise to offer in the classroom and workplace.

For some STMs, this is a first-time working experience, providing crucial workplace experience. Others have been able to leave exhausting, dead-end jobs in sweatshops and fast-food restaurants. An STM position, in contrast, focuses students' energy at the college and helps them acquire new perspective on learning and teaching -- even as they gain entry-level access to rewarding professional careers.<p></p></div><!---libtext-->
